Hello there!
There is nothing hidden that is not shown – you`ll see what I mean in just a moment.
Recently you were browsing a website that has pornographic content and yes, I saw you masturbating.
It is not my duty to teach you what to do or how to do it
I want you to pay me to keep this thing private
You`ll have to take care of this finance-related issue
Before you question yourself how did that happened, I`ll tell you
How did I get it?
While you were browsing porn sites you accidentally installed the malware I used to hack the website
So consequently I`ve hacked your computer
I`ve got all your names and passwords, access to your email, messengers and other things
If you want to know my secret, I used keylogger
When I got ahold of your desktop I immediately installed keylogger on your system
There was one other program involved, I’m not gonna tell you which but it gave me access to your webcam so I recorded all the things you did in front of the computer
Guess what I filmed? You masturbating
I am sure your friends and family will be delighted to see you do your dirty business, a long time will pass before you can get clean of all this mess
Okay, here is what you should do (if you do exactly what I ask, I will delete that embarrassing video and let you be)
You must send 650 us dollars To my bitcoin wallet 1FXTXQEWFaPukDUWcMYnbgae1FpPtYNyA6
That`s it, it`s all you have to do
Don`t waste your time replying to this email I`m not gonna read it but the system will notify me when you make the payment. After you read this message, you have 24 hours to make the payment. You can reply to this email in case you need more time (48 hours max) to collect the money.
I hope you understand everything I`ve mentioned. Sorry for my English, it isn’t particularly popular in my country
P.S. I`am expecting to see the money on my account within 24 hours
